# Water Quality Statistics

In this chapter, we set out to predict pollution load in stormwater
runoff through the use of landscape spatial predictors to describe
chemical presence in stormwater. Currently, stormwater managers often
rely on categorical land use designations (high vs. low density
residential, commercial, industrial) to approximate chemical loading in
stormwater. While this method is convenient, it has some limitations:
categorical land use designations vary by jurisdiction, limiting
applicability of findings between jurisdictions over a landscape.

Our objectives were to:

1.  Find a stronger, more data-driven method of predicting chemical
    loading compared to the current method, which relies on categorical
    land use designations to assign pollution loads, rather than
    continuous, quantifiable landscape spatial predictors that can be
    objectively measured across large landscapes spanning multiple
    stormwater jurisdictional boundaries. 
2.  Determine whether a landscape spatial predictor approach produces
    stronger predictive power than either a null model or the current
    categorical land use mode.

We developed models using spatial predictors to estimate concentrations
for constituents of concern (COCs) in Puget Sound urban stormwater.
Spatial predictors that we drew from included various landscape
predictors, rainfall, seasonal components, and percent land use
(commercial, industrial, residential). These models were then compared
with models using categorical land use classifications (high density
residential, low density residential, commercial and industrial) to
compare model fit and predictive ability. The best fit models are
translated to the Stormwater Heatmap communication tool using colors to
show predicted pollutant load based on spatial landscape predictors.

We also wanted to provide stormwater managers with an understanding of
the underlying variability in predicted pollutant concentrations
presented on the Stormwater Heatmap. We achieved this on a
watershed-basis by calculating Bayesian 80% confidence intervals (known
as credibility intervals) for each watershed. This information can be
accessed in the Stormwater Heatmap by clicking on a watershed to view a
pop-up window indicating the 80% upper and lower credibility intervals
for that watershed.

## Data Sources

### Outfall Data

The primary source of measured stormwater data is the S8.D Municipal
Stormwater Permit Outfall Data (referred to as the S8 Data in this
document) provided by the Washington Department of Ecology (Hobbs et
al., 2015). Special Condition S8.D of the 2007-2012 Phase I Municipal
Stormwater Permit required permittees to collect and analyze data to
evaluate pollutant loads in stormwater discharged from different land
uses: high density (HD) residential, low density (LD) residential,
commercial, and industrial. Phase I Permittees[^1] collected water
quality and flow data, sediment data, and toxicity information from
stormwater discharges during storm events. Stormwater data collected
from a total of 16 outfalls by six Phase I Permittees was utilized in
this modeling study.

[^1]: Phase I Permittees include: cities of Tacoma and Seattle; King,
    Snohomish, Pierce and Clark counties; Ports of Tacoma and Seattle. 
    For this study, all data were used with the exception of those from
    Clark County (outside of the Puget Sound region) and Port of Seattle
    (too different from all other Puget Sound watersheds).

The stormwater outfall data are available from Ecology via an open-data
api at:
[https://data.wa.gov/Natural-Resources-Environment/Municipal-Stormwater-
Permit-Outfall-Data/d958-q2ci.](https://data.wa.gov/Natural-Resources-Environment/Municipal-Stormwater-%20Permit-Outfall-Data/d958-q2ci.%20)

COCs analyzed in this study are:

-   Copper -- Total

-   Total Suspended Solids (TSS)

-   Phosphorus -- Total

-   Zinc - Total

-   Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN)

We extracted data for these COCs, and performed minimal data cleaning.
We filtered out rejected data (values with a R or REJ flag), removed
replicates, and removed one data point for TKN that was an outlier (an
order of magnitude higher than the majority of the data). Figure 4.1
shows data before removal of the outlier.

### Censored (Non-Detect) Data

Nearly all COCs had non-detect (left-censored) data present (Table 4.1).
Ecology flagged non-detect data and provided the reporting limit for
each non-detect value. Most COCs had a very small percentage of data
that were non-detect (2% or less); one COC, TKN, had a higher level of
non-detect data (just over 10%). For all COCs, non-detect values were
substituted with one-half of the reporting limit. Models using censored
methods were compared to linear models for TKN to verify that data
substitution on linear mixed effects models generated suitable results.

(non-detect) for each chemical of concern

### Transformation of outfall data

Each COC was then evaluated for its underlying distribution, to
determine whether transformation would be beneficial prior to running a
linear mixed effects model on the results. Quantile-quantile plots (QQ
plots) using a normal distribution, gamma distribution, square-root
transformed distribution, and log-transformed distribution were visually
analyzed. For all COC's, log-transformation was deemed an appropriate
data transformation prior to model analysis (Fig. 4.2).

**Figure 4.2** Quantile-quantile plots of COCs using a natural-log (ln)
scale. Red line shows the QQ-line.

## Spatial Data

For this study, we did not rely on the permittee's self-reported land
use type to run regression models predicting pollution loading from land
use. A visual scan of our land cover data layer versus self-reported
land use types revealed little agreement among permittee definitions of
the four land use types (high density residential, low density
residential, commercial, industrial). Therefore, we compiled a suite of
continuous datasets from which to run chemical loading models. We divide
these into land use and landscape data.

### Land Use

In order to employ a consistent analysis across different monitored
watersheds we extracted land use data from the Washington Department of
Commerce Land Use: Puget Sound Mapping Project
(<https://www.commerce.wa.gov/serving-communities/growth-management/puget-sound-mapping-project>).
Land use classes (also listed in Table 4.2) include:

-   Intensive urban (includes commercial areas, apartment buildings)

-   Urban residential (includes the majority of urban and suburban
    single-family dwellings)

-   Rural residential

-   Industrial

In addition, we combined some land use classes to generate additional
land use classes:

-   Total residential (urban residential + rural residential)

-   Intensive Urban + Industrial; the industrial land use category did
    not have many non-zero data points

### Landscape Data

For each watershed contained in the S8 dataset, potentially relevant
landscape data were extracted from the following sources (Table 4.2):

### Pre-processing of spatial data

In order to use the landscape data at an appropriate scale across the
study area, spatial predictors were stacked and then convolved with a
100-meter gaussian kernel. This resulted in "fuzzy" predictors that
could apply across dataset boundaries. These values were then extracted
for each monitored watershed.

Prior to use, spatial data were plotted and visually assessed for
outliers (Fig. 4.3). Square-root transformation was performed on spatial
data sets with outliers that were higher than the rest of the
predictor's values: popn, traffic, slope, CO2_res, CO2_com, CO2_road,
CO2_nonroad, CO2_tot. The devAge spatial predictor had a low data
outlier; devAge values were squared to address the low outlier
(devAge\^2). Figure 4.4 shows the spatial data following transformation.

Prior to use in models, spatial data sets were scaled and centered using
the mean and standard deviation from the 14 watersheds in this study.

### Precipitation Data

Daily rainfall data were obtained from the DayMet website operated by
NASA (<https://daymet.ornl.gov/>). Daily data were obtained for years
2009 to 2013, and cumulative one day, three day, seven day, 14-day,
21-day and 28-day antecedent precipitation were calculated for each
sampling date. For example, for a sampling date of March 22, cumulative
three-day precipitation would include precipitation occurring on March
20, 21 and 22. For each COC, *ln*-transformed chemical concentrations
were plotted against each precipitation measurement, and the plots were
visually assessed to select the most appropriate time scale for
precipitation. Cumulative 21-day precipitation was selected for copper
and phosphorus, while 1-day precipitation was selected for TSS.

## Model Construction and Selection

The structure of the data, with multiple data points over time for each
of the 14 watersheds, indicated that mixed effects models would be
appropriate. We considered both a frequentist statistical framework, as
well as a Bayesian framework for running the mixed effects models, and
ended up utilizing a combination of the two. The frequentist framework
is significantly faster to perform, and was used to identify the best
set of landscape predictors as fixed effects, as well as to identify the
best variance structure (see Steps 1-7, below).

Once the best fit model was selected, we fit the same model in a
Bayesian framework; this allowed us to estimate credibility intervals
around predicted values. Frequentist statistical methods are not able to
properly estimate variability around random effects, so Bayesian methods
were needed for this step.

Within a frequentist statistical framework, selection of the best model
for each COC was performed using the methodology of Zuur al. (2009), as
outlined in Steps 1-7 below. Statistical analyses and model fitting were
performed in R (R Core Team, 2021). Following the frequentist analysis,
we moved into a Bayesian framework for Steps 8-9, which included model
examination and credibility interval calculations.

### Step 1. Select strong potential landscape predictors

The initial step was to find a suitable set of potential landscape
predictors for the COC in question. Single-predictor linear models were
constructed for the relationship between *ln*-transformed chemical
concentration and each landscape predictor, in turn. Plots were visually
assessed to determine candidate predictors for linear mixed effects
models. We looked for slopes with a p-value of \< 0.05, and for data
points to fall roughly along the best fit model line.

### Step 2. Construct a beyond-optimal model, controlling for collinearity

The starting point of our model selection process was a "beyond-optimal"
model, where the fixed component of the mixed effects model contained as
many strong landscape predictors as possible, as well as weather-based
temporal components with potential importance (cumulative precipitation,
season, antecedant dry days):

$$Result_{ijk} = fixed.effects_{ijk} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

Subscripts indicate sample (*i*), location (*j*) and agency (*k*), and
$$\epsilon_{ijk} $$indicates unexplained error for each sample. To
prevent using highly correlated landscape predictors together in
statistical models, we calculated the correlation coefficient for each
pair of landscape predictors, and eliminated select predictors to reduce
correlation. We then constructed a generalized least squared (gls) model
in R (nlme package, Pinheiro et al., 2021) using the beyond-optimal set
of fixed effects, and utilizing restricted maximum likelihood estimation
(REML).

Throughout the model selection process, highly correlated landscape
predictors (correlation coefficient ≥0.85) were not used together in any
models.

### Step 3. Control for heterogeneity (heteroskedasticity)

Normalized residuals from the "beyond-optimal" gls model were plotted
against the model's fitted values, and examined for heteroskedasticity.
We also plotted residuals against agency, year, season, land use,
cumulative precipitation, antecedent dry days, and all potential
predictors, to look for patterns in residuals. If residual plots showed
evidence of heteroskedasticity, we tried a series of gls models (fitted
with REML) with different variance structures that utilized agency,
location, season, and precipitation as variance covariates. Variance
structure for each COC was selected based on the lowest Akaike
information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
scores.

If no heteroskedasticity is present, residuals are assumed to be
normally distributed, with mean 0 and standard deviation $$\sigma$$

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma) 
$$

Controlling for heteroskedasticity often involved allowing each location
*j* or each agency *k* to have a different standard deviation, such
that:

$$
sd(\epsilon_{ijk})=\sigma_j; \quad\text{  }\quad \epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma_j)
$$

or

$$
sd(\epsilon_{ijk})=\sigma_k; \quad\text{  }\quad \epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma_k)
$$

### Step 4. Find the proper random effects structure

Next, we used the beyond-optimal model with the correct variance
structure to find the proper random effects structure. In the case of
our data set, we had six sampling agencies, each with 1 to 3 locations,
and multiple samples collected over time at each location. The nested
structure of our data, along with our interest in using the model to
predict results in locations that haven't been sampled (rather than to
compare sampled locations and agencies to each other), led to the
identification of *agency* and *location* as potential nested random
effects. In this situation, the random part of a nested mixed effects
model has the form:

$$
random.effects_{ijk} = a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

where $a_k$ is a random intercept that allows for variation between
agencies, while $a_{j|k}$ represents variation between locations (*j*)
from the same agency (*k*). We assumed that $a_k$ and $a_{j|k}$ are
normally distributed, with standard deviations given below:

$$
a_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{agency})
$$

$$
a_{j|k}\sim N(0, \sigma_{location})
$$

The beyond-optimal gls model was compared to a linear mixed effects
(lme) nested random-intercept model (nlme package, Pinheiro et al.,
2021) fitted with REML, where the intercept was allowed to change per
agency, and per location nested within agency. Because the gls model and
the random-intercept model are nested models, they were compared using a
likelihood ratio test to see if one model was significantly better than
the other (p-value \< 0.05). The best-fit model was then selected based
on the lowest AIC value. For all COCs, the nested random-intercept model
fit the data better than the gls model with no random effects.

Intuitively, a random intercept for location nested within agency is
suitable for the stormwater data. Each location was sampled multiple
times over the 4-year data collection period, and we would expect data
within a location to be more similar than data between two locations.
Additionally, agencies may have differed slightly in sample collection
methodologies, including: timing of sample collection once a storm
began, selection of laboratory for sample analysis, and any biases in
selection of representative watersheds. These differences could lead to
variability in COC results by agency, and can be neatly captured in the
random component of the model.

### Step 5. Check for temporal and spatial correlation

The beyond-optimal model with the correct variance structure and random
effects structure was then examined for evidence of temporal and spatial
auto-correlation. Temporal auto-correlation plots were generated and
visually assessed for indications of correlation between various
sampling time lags; no evidence of temporal autocorrelation was found
for any COC. Spatial auto-correlation was assessed through two methods:
variograms, and spatially-explicit bubble plots of model residuals; no
evidence of significant spatial autocorrelation was found for any COC.

All tests for temporal and spatial auto-correlation were repeated
following selection of best-fit models.

### Step 6. Find the proper fixed effects structure

We used the strong potential landscape predictors from Step 1 to
generate an exhaustive set of fixed-effects formulae with combinations
of one, two and three potential landscape predictors. Predictors with
high correlation coefficients (≥0.85) were not allowed to be in formulae
together.

A set of models was generated using the fixed effects formulae, along
with the best-fit random effects and variance structures identified in
steps 3 and 4. Linear mixed effects models were applied using the nlme
package (Pinheiro et al, 2021), and fitting with maximum likelhood (ML)
estimation[^2]. Models where the sign (+ or --) of the predictor
coefficients did not match the coefficient signs from the linear model
from Step 1 were discarded. Models were then sorted according to AIC
value, and the top 20 models were examined for fit to individual
predictors. If weak landscape or temporal predictors (p-value \> 0.05)
were present in the model, these were eliminated, then plots of
residuals versus fitted values, agency, location, and landscape
predictors were examined. One to three candidate models were selected
for consideration as the best landscape predictor model. These candidate
models all had low AIC values, acceptable residual plots, and good fit
to individual landscape predictors. The form of the candidate models
was:

[^2]: As described in Faraway (2006), pg 156, REML estimation should not
    be used to compare models with different fixed effects because REML
    estimates the random effects by considering linear combinations of
    the data that remove the fixed effects. If the fixed effects change,
    the likelihoods of the two models will not be directly comparable.
    However, REML is generally considered to give better estimates for
    the random effects, so final models were fitted with REML

$$
Result_{ijk}=fixed.effects_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

Using knowledge of chemical contaminant mobilization into stormwater, we
selected the best landscape predictor model for each COC.

### Step 7. Final model comparison to categorical land use models

Currently, stormwater managers often rely on categorical land use
designations to approximate COC concentrations in stormwater. We set out
to provide better COC approximations through the use of landscape
predictors to describe COC presence in stormwater. To assess the
suitability of models built with landscape predictors, three models were
ultimately fitted with REML and compared for each COC.

1.  **Null Model:** COC concentration is equal to median COC
    concentration over all sampling dates and locations

2.  **Categorical Land Use Model:** COC concentration is modeled as a
    linear mixed effects model, utilizing land use category (HDR, LDR,
    COM, IND), precipitation (rainfall and/or antecedent dry days), and
    season (for COCs where a seasonal trend appeared in the data).

3.  **Landscape Predictor Model:** COC concentration is modeled as a
    linear mixed effects model, utilizing up to three landscape
    predictors, precipitation (rainfall and/or antecedent dry days), and
    season (for COCs where a seasonal trend appeared in the data).

We compared these three models using AIC, to determine which model had
the best fit to data. For all COCs analyzed, the landscape predictor
model out-performed the null model and the categorical land use model;
thus, the landscape predictor model for each COC was pushed forward for
Bayesian model analysis. In the case of total phosphorus, an even
simpler model including only rainfall and seasonal components had a
slight improvement over the landscape predictor model in the frequentist
framework, so both models were pushed forward for Bayesian model
analysis.

The Bayesian models were expected to yield very similar parameter values
as the frequentist models; however, Bayesian analysis also allows
accurate confidence intervals (called credibility intervals in Bayesian
statistics) to be estimated around predicted values. Frequentist mixed
effects models are not capable of accurately estimating variability
around random effects, so confidence intervals calculated using
frequentist statistics underestimate the uncertainty around each
prediction.

### Step 8. Bayesian model analysis

The best fit frequentist model structure from Step 7 (made up of the
variance structure from Step 3, random effects structure from Step 4,
and fixed effects structure [weather + landscape predictors] from Step
6) was then applied to a Bayesian framework using the brms package in R
(Buerkner, 2017). The brms package provides an R interface for
performing Bayesian multi-level (mixed effects) regression models using
the programming language "Stan" in the background (Stan Development
Team, 2022).

The brms algorithm accepts a prior distribution for each parameter (we
assumed an uninformative prior distribution for each spatial predictor:
Normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 10), and
provides an output of 4000 sets of parameter estimates that collectively
make up what is called the posterior. The parameter sets vary in their
likelihood given the data, and the parameter set with the highest
likelihood is used in the Stormwater Heatmap.

Models were examined for the following elements:

1.  [model convergence]{.underline} and adequate sampling of the
    parameter space using posterior traces. These address the questions:
    did the model look at enough parameter values? Was it able to find a
    best fit model?

2.  [appropriateness of the variance structure]{.underline}. For some
    COCs, the difference in AIC value between models using location vs.
    agency as a variance covariate was small. In these cases, the
    best-fit fixed effects and random effects structures were applied to
    models with different variance structures. The resulting models were
    compared using the leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC -
    similar to AIC, where lower values indicate better model fit) to
    identify the best variance structure.

3.  [model diagnostics]{.underline} using leave-one-out cross-validation
    (LOOCV) to calculate the Pareto *k* shape parameter. The Pareto *k*
    shape parameter provides an assessment of reliability and
    convergence rate of the Bayesian model estimator: a Pareto *k* value
    is calculated for each data point, and influencial outliers that may
    reduce the model's reliability are identified by Pareto *k* values
    \> 0.7. When we identified models with Pareto *k* values above 0.7,
    we fitted Bayesian models using an underlying Student-t distribution
    rather than the default Gaussian distribution, to see if this
    resolved the issue. The Student-t distribution has thicker tails,
    which can encompass some more extreme observations observations.
    Models utilizing the Student-t distribution include an extra
    parameter, $\nu$, for describing the shape of the Student-t
    distribution; this extra parameter was estimated by the Bayesian
    model in cases where a model using the Student-t distribution
    provided the best fit.

4.  [graphical posterior predictive checking]{.underline}. We generated
    density plots of observed data along with simulated values from the
    posterior predictive distribution, to ensure that predictions fit
    observed data. We also examined observed vs. predicted plots.
    Graphical posterior predictive checking addresses the questions: Did
    the model correctly approximate the posterior distribution? Knowing
    that models are useful fiction and always fail in some way, how does
    *our* model fail?

The Bayesian model with the best variance structure and appropriate
underlying distribution (Gaussian or Student-t) was then used to
generate the heatmap layer, and to calculate credibility intervals.

### Step 9. Obtain Credibility Intervals from Bayesian model

Using the Bayesian model from Step 8, we calculated 80% credibility
intervals (80% CIs; analagous to confidence intervals in frequentist
statistics) for all watersheds in the heatmap region. These 80% CIs can
be accessed on the Stormwater Heatmap by clicking on a watershed for
additional details in a pop-up window. The 80% CI can be interpreted as
follows: there is an 80% probability that the true (unknown) COC
concentration will lie within the interval, given the evidence provided
by the observed data.

Watersheds were first "reduced" to obtain median values over each
watershed for relevant spatial landscape predictors (e.g.,
*sqrt_traffic* and *devAge2* for copper). Three watershed reductions
with different boundaries were used: Puget Sound Assessment Units
(PSAU), the USGS watershed boundary dataset (HUC12), and the National
Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus).

Watershed 80% CIs need to account for a variety of realistic
precipitation and summer regimes, because these factors are important
predictors in most of the COC models. We generated a set of realistic
precipitation and summer regimes by randomly sampling 10% of the S8 data
(47 samples total) for combined rain and summer conditions. Forty-two of
the samples were randomly taken from non-summer conditions, and five
samples were randomly taken from summer conditions; this approximated
the summer/ non-summer breakdown in S8 data, where 11% of data points
were collected during summer.

Credibility intervals for each watershed reduction were calculated using
the fitted function (brms package; Buerkner, 2017) applied to a new
dataset (newdata) containing all watersheds in the reduction, each
paired with all 47 precipitation/summer conditions. The fitted function
runs each entry in the newdata through all 4000 parameter combinations
generated in the Bayesian model to come up with 4000\*47 estimates for
COC concentration at each watershed. We then manually grouped estimates
by watershed and summarized for median, upper 80% CI and lower 80% CI.
In this way, we were able to integrate precipitation and summer
conditions into the 80% CIs.

In multi-level (mixed effects) Bayesian models such as those in this
study, there exist several versions of credibility intervals to address
interest in the population-level versus grouping levels (in our case,
location), or in previously sampled locations versus new locations. For
this study, we are interested in 80% CIs for new, unsampled locations,
where the 80% interval corresponds to the mean COC concentration at the
new location, assuming that the new location is sampled many times.

The 80% CIs presented here account for two of the three sources of model
uncertainty:

1.  uncertainty around the population-level intercept ($\beta_0$) and
    around the fixed effects parameters associated with spatial
    landscape predictors $\beta_3$ and $\beta_4$; and

2.  uncertainty around the variance parameters of the groups:
    $\sigma_{agency}$ and $\sigma_{location}$.

Residual (observation-level) variance, $\epsilon_{ijk}$, is not
accounted for in 80% CIs.

### Step 10. Translating Bayesian models to the Stormwater Heatmap

Bayesian model equations are substantially simplified for the Stormwater
Heatmap communication tool, which displays mean predicted COC
concentrations. Landscape predictors that are temporal in nature (rain
and summer) are set to their mean value of 0, and the variance structure
and nested random effects terms are also set to their mean values of 0.
Thus the generic COC equation: $$
\ln(COC_{ijk}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1*rain_i + \beta_2*summer_i + \beta_3*predictor1_{ijk} + \beta_4*predictor2_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

$$
a_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{agency})
$$

$$
a_{j|k}\sim N(0, \sigma_{location})
$$

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma_k)
$$

simplifies to:

$$
\ln(COC) = \beta_0 + \beta_3*predictor1 + \beta_4*predictor2
$$

for the Stormwater Heatmap. See the section **Translating Equations to
the Stormwater Heatmap** at the end of this chapter for more details.

## Results

Results for each COC are provided below.

### Copper

Based on linear models of *ln*-transformed copper versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for copper include: totRes,
intURB, intURB_IND, grass, greenery, impervious, nodev, sqrt_traffic,
sqrt_popn, pm25_na, sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_com, sqrt_CO2_road,
sqrt_CO2_nonroad, devAge2, roof_intURB_IND (Fig 4.5).

![](images/Copper%20strong%20predictors%20fig_4_5.bmp)

**Figure 4.5** Strong predictors for copper, showing linear model fit
(blue line) for the relationship between ln-transformed copper
concentration and each predictor in turn.

The precipitation predictor used for copper was 21-day cumulative
precipitation. In addition, evidence of higher copper concentrations
during summer led us to add *summer* as a categorical predictor to the
copper model, where *summer* = 1 during July, August, September, and
*summer* = 0 for all other months.

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight
heterogeneity (Fig 4.6, top left). Of the variance structures tested,
the best fit allows residual variation to differ by location *j.*

$$
sd(\epsilon_{ijk}) = \sigma_j
$$

![](images/Copper%20variance%20structure%20plot.bmp)

**Figure 4.6** Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no
variance structure (top left), with agency as a variance covariate (top
right), and with location as a variance covariate (bottom left).
Location as the variance covariate provided the best model fit.

#### Frequentist Model Summary

The best model for copper is a random-intercept model, where the
intercept of the linear model is allowed to vary by agency (*k*), and by
location within each agency (*j*\|*k*). No signs of temporal or spatial
auto-correlation were detected in auto-correlation plots or variograms.

Two possible models emerged to capture the fixed effects:

$$
ln(Cu_{ijk}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * rain_i + \beta_2 * summer_i + \beta_3 * sqrt\_CO_2\_road_{ijk} + \beta_4 * devAge2_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

$$
ln(Cu_{ijk}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * rain_i + \beta_2 * summer_i + \beta_3 * sqrt\_traffic_{ijk} + \beta_4 * devAge2_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

The first model's AIC score was slightly lower than that of the second
model (AIC=699.3 vs. 700.9, when models were fitted with ML); however,
vehicle wear is more directly associated with copper in stormwater than
are emissions. As a result, we selected the second model, with
*sqrt_traffic* as a predictor. Figure 4.7 shows the model fit for each
individual predictor, plotted against data points. Correlation between
the two predictors was low (correlation = 0.3).

![](images/Copper%20single%20predictors%20plot.bmp)

**Figure 4.7** Single-predictor plots for copper, showing fit of the
Landscape Predictor Model to each predictor in turn. Model fitting was
performed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig. 4.8)
and comparative metrics such as AIC. The residual plots clearly show
good fit (residuals close to zero) for the Categorical Landuse Model and
for the Landscape Predictor Model.

![](images/Copper%20residual%20plot%20for%203%20models.bmp)

**Figure 4.8** Copper model residuals for the Null Model, Categorical
Land Use Model, and Landscape Predictor Model. Each bar represents one
watershed, with colors representing agencies. Model fitting was
performed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Final frequentist model AIC values (fitted with REML) for the three
models are: 1317.1 (Null Model), 721.9 (Categorical Landuse Model) and
720.6 (Landscape Predictor Model), with the Landscape Predictor Model
showing a slight improvement over the Categorical Landuse Model. Final
coefficient values for all three frequentist models are shown in Figure
4.9. The large variability in model coefficients for the Categorical
Landuse Model (shown in blue) indicates lower predictive power, because
confidence intervals on predictions will be large. Thus, even though the
AIC values are similar between the Categorical Landuse and Landscape
Predictor models, the Landscape Predictor model outperforms the
currently used Categorical Landuse-type model in terms of generating
prediction ranges for copper pollution. We therefore selected this
improved method of predicting COC loading for inclusion in the
Stormwater Heatmap's data visualizations.

(green), Categorical Land Use Model (blue), and Landscape Predictor
Model (red). These coefficient values for linear mixed effects models

estimation, and may differ slightly from those fitted using maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation.

#### Bayesian Model Summary

The Bayesian model for total copper follows a Student-t distribution
with the form:

$$
\ln(Cu_{ijk}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1*rain_{i} + \beta_2*summer_{i} + \beta_3*sqrt\_traffic_{ijk} + *devAge2_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

where:

$$
\beta_0 = 2.33;\quad\text{  }\quad \beta_1 = -0.18;\quad\text{  }\quad \beta_2=0.37;\quad\text{  }\quad \beta_3=0.43;\quad\text{  }\quad \beta_4=0.46
$$

$$
a_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{agency});\quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{agency} = 0.21
$$

$$
a_{j|k}\sim N(0, \sigma_{location}); \quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{location} = 0.45
$$

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \sim t_{7.8}(0, \sigma_j); \quad\text{    }\quad ln(\sigma_j) = \eta + u_j; \quad\text{    }\quad \sigma_j = e^{\eta} * e^{u_j}; \quad\text{    }\quad \eta=-0.91; 
$$ $$ 
u_j \sim N(0,\sigma_0); \quad\text{    }\quad \sigma_0=0.21
$$

Rain is 21-day cumulative precipitation, standardized; summer is a
factor with value = 1 for July, August, September, and value = 0 for all
other months. Both landscape predictors (traffic and development age)
were first transformed then standardized prior to use. Subscripts
indicate sample (*i*), location (*j*) and agency (*k*).

Random effects $a_k$ (agency-specific contribution to the intercept) and
$a_{j|k}$ (location-specific contribution to the intercept) follow a
normal (Gaussian) distribution, with mean equal to 0 and standard
deviation equal to $\sigma_{agency}$ for agency-specific contribution to
the intercept, and $\sigma_{location}$ for location-specific
contribution to the intercept. The residual variance $\epsilon_{ijk}$
represents remaining variation in the data that cannot be explained by
the model variables. For the copper model, residual variance follows a
Student-t distribution, which is defined by three parameters: shape
($\nu=7.8$) , mean ($\mu=0$) and scale ($\sigma= \sigma_j$). By imposing
a variance structure with location (*j*) as the variance covariate,
scale ($\sigma_j$) becomes a function of parameters $\eta$ and $u_j$,
where $e^{\eta}$ represents population-level variability, and $e^{u_j}$
represents deviation of location *j* from the population-level
variability. Finally, $u_j$ is normally distributed, with mean equal to
0 and standard deviation equal to $\sigma_0$.

Density plots for the 4000 sets of parameter estimates generated by the
Bayesian model are provided in the left half of Figs. 4.10 and 4.11.
Like histograms, density plots show the most likely value along the
horizontal axis for the given parameter as the highest point in the
curve. They also indicate how much variability exists around parameter
estimates, shown by the shape of the curve (low and broad equals lots of
variability; tall and narrow equals little variability). The area under
the curve represents probability, and integrates to 1. Traces (right
half of Figs. 4.10 and 4.11) indicate how well the parameter space was
sampled in the four chains generated by the NUTS (no U-turn sampling -
an extension of Hamilton Monte Carlo) sampler used when fitting brms
models. Each chain generated 1000 sets of parameter estimates, for a
total of 4000 sets of parameter estimates. For copper, the traces
indicate that the sampling algorithm did not get stuck in one region of
the parameter space, and that the parameter space was well sampled.

$\beta_2$, b_sqrt_traffic corresponds to $\beta_3$, and b_devAge2

$\sigma_{location}$, sd_location\_\_sigma_Intercept represents

Student-t distribution.

Fit of the Bayesian copper model to data can be visualized in predicted
versus observed plots (Figs. 4.12 and 4.13). In these plots, the
predicted *ln*(copper) values (vertical axis) are generated by applying
the spatial predictors associated with each data point (location, rain,
summer, sqrt_traffic, devAge2) to all 4000 parameter sets that make up
the Bayesian posterior. Median predicted values, along with 95%
quantiles, are then plotted against observed *ln*(copper) data
(horizontal axis). Ideally, the points should form a swath along the 1:1
diagonal dashed line. This 1:1 line shows where posterior predictions
exactly match the observed data. For copper, the predicted vs. observed
plots show slightly better model fit at higher copper concentrations
(Fig. 4.12), evident because points in the upper right quadrant are
closer to the 1:1 line than points in the lower left quadrant.
Within-location variability in the upper right quadrant of Figure 4.12
is lower than for the lower left quadrant. Locations with higher copper
concentrations also have medium to high values of sqrt_traffic and high
values of devAge2 (Fig. 4.13, top panels). This could be coincidental,
or could be the result of high temporal variability in
copper-contributing sources (e.g., traffic) in low-traffic locations.

Summer and rain do not display a consistent effect on the Bayesian
model's fit to observed data (Fig. 4.13, bottom panels).

![](images/Bayesian%20Copper_obs%20vs%20pred%201.bmp)**Figure 4.12**
Predicted vs. observed plot for the Bayesian copper model, with point
color corresponding to location. Individual points show how the observed
value for *ln*(copper) (horizontal axis) compares to the median
predicted value from the Bayesian model (vertical axis). Thin gray
vertical lines associated with each point provide the 95% quantiles for
each prediction. Note that residual error is excluded from the
predictions, resulting in narrower 95% quantiles. The diagonal dashed
line shows the 1:1 relationship, where predicted=observed.

showing the magnitude of one spatial predictor (sqrt_traffic, devAge2,

observed value for *ln*(copper) compares to the median predicted value
from the Bayesian model. Diagonal dashed lines show the 1:1
relationship, where predicted=observed.

Expected median copper concentration as a function of traffic or
development age are presented in Figure 4.14, with S8 Data---used in
fitting the Bayesian model---plotted as black points atop the prediction
intervals. Expected median copper concentration as a function of traffic
(left half of Fig. 4.14) integrates over rainfall, season, and
development age, to produce 50%, 80% and 95% prediction interval bands.
Similarly, expected median copper concentration as a function of
development age (right half of Fig. 4.14) integrates over rainfall,
season and traffic to produce prediction interval bands.

Expected prediction intervals were generated for a simulated data set,
with all combinations of the following predictor values:

-   20% of rain & summer combinations were sampled from the S8 data, to
    provide representative scenarios of rain and summer/ not summer
    conditions;

-   eight equally-spaced traffic values between minimum and maximum
    traffic levels (following transformation and standardization) from
    the S8 data;

-   eight equally-spaced development age values between the minimum and
    maximum development age levels (following transformation and
    standardization) from the S8 data.

Expected prediction intervals were calculated using the epred_draws
function (tidybayes package; Kay, 2022). Landscape predictors were then
unstandardized and back-transformed to generate Figure 4.14.

Expected prediction intervals account for two of the three sources of
model uncertainty:

1.  uncertainty around the fixed effect parameters
    $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ and $\beta_4$ (see posterior
    densities in Fig. 4.10), and

2.  uncertainty around the variance parameters of the groups:
    $\sigma_{agency}$ and $\sigma_{location}$ (see corresponding
    posterior densities in Fig. 4.11).

Residual (observation-level) variance, $\epsilon_{ijk}$, is not
accounted for in expected prediction intervals. This allows stormwater
managers to assess the following:

-   What is the prediction range for median copper at a heretofore
    unsampled watershed with a particular level of traffic (or
    development age)?

Looking at the prediction range for median COC value (rather than the
prediction range for a single sample) is in line with stormwater
management best practices, which manage for the over-annual impact on
water bodies rather than for extreme events.

![](images/Bayesian%20Copper_pred%20int%20vs%20raw%20data.bmp)**Figure
4.14** Expected prediction intervals for total copper as a function of
raw traffic (Annual Average Daily Traffic; left half) and development
age (right half). Expected predictions account for two sources of model
uncertainty: the uncertainty around the fixed coefficients, and the
uncertainty around the variance parameters of the groups:
$\sigma_{agency}$ and $\sigma_{location}$. Variance around individual
observations (observation-level residual variance, $\epsilon_{ijk}$) is
not accounted for in expected predictions. Bands of color represent
prediction intervals for 50%, 80% and 95%, while black points represent
S8 stormwater data that were used in fitting the Bayesian model.

The Bayesian copper model has a population-level intercept
$\beta_0=2.33$. As a random-intercept model, the location-specific
intercept is allowed to vary by agency (*k*), and by location within
each agency (*j*\|*k*), and sums to: $\beta_0 + a_k + a_{j|k}$. Density
plots for the location-specific intercept parameters are shown in Figure
4.15, along with the median and 95% credibility intervals for the
population-level intercept. Seven of the 14 sampling locations have
location-specific intercepts that overlap well with the population-level
intercept: the majority of their density plots are shaded blue (see
e.g., TAC_COM). Four additional locations have approximately half of
their density plot overlapping with that of the population-level
intercept (see e.g., TAC_IND). The remaining three locations have
location-specific intercepts that are quite different from that of the
population (see TAC_HDR, SNO_COM, SEA_IND). The amount of variability
between location-specific intercepts is indicative of how much
y-intercept values might vary for unsampled locations.

The Stormwater Heatmap utilizes only the population-level intercept to
provide median copper predictions at unsampled locations; Figure 4.15 is
presented here to give the reader a visual sense for how much
variability exists between locations, in terms of location-specific
intercept.

![](images/Bayesian%20Copper_intercepts.bmp)**Figure 4.15** Density
plots for the 14 location-specific intercept parameters, along with the
median (thick vertical line) and 95% credibility intervals (dashed
vertical lines) for the population-level intercept. For each location,
the median intercept value is indicated with a black dot, and
credibility intervals are shown with thick (50% CI) and thin (95% CI)
black horizontal lines. Density plots for each location are shaded blue
for values that fall within the 95% CI for the population-level
intercept, and gray for values that fall outside of the 95% CI for
population-level intercept. Note that the population-level 95% CI does
not incorporate variability around agency $\sigma_{agency}$, or around
location within each agency $\sigma_{location}$; it is solely the 95% CI
for the population-level intercept (i.e.: 95% of the time, the
population-level intercept will fall between the given CI values).

The Stormwater Heatmap utilizes the spatial landscape predictors
*sqrt_traffic* and *devAge2* to calculate the median predicted copper
concentration over all seasons and precipitation regimes. The equation
used for the copper layer is:

$$
\ln(Cu) = 2.33 + 0.43*sqrt\_traffic + 0.46*devAge2
$$

### Total Suspended Solids

Based on linear models of *ln*-transformed TSS versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for TSS include: totRES,
sqrt_traffic, sqrt_popn, sqrt_CO2_res, sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_com,
sqrt_CO2_road, devAge2 (Fig 4.11).

![](images/TSS%20strong%20predictors.bmp)

**Figure 4.11** Strong predictors for TSS, showing linear model fit
(blue line) for the relationship between *ln*-transformed TSS
concentration and each predictor in turn.

The precipitation predictor used for TSS was 1-day cumulative
precipitation. There was no evidence of seasonal patterns to TSS in
stormwater.

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight
heterogeneity (Fig 4.12, top left plot). Of the variance structures
tested, the best fit allows residual variation to differ by location
*j*.

$$
sd(\epsilon_{ijk}) = \sigma_j 
$$

![](images/TSS%20variance%20structure%20plot.bmp)

**Figure 4.12** Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no
variance structure (top left), with agency as a variance covariate (top
right) and with location as a variance covariate (bottom left). Location
as the variance covariate provided the best model fit.

The best model for TSS is a random-intercept model, where the intercept
of the linear model is allowed to vary by agency (*k*), and by location
within each agency (*j*\|*k*). No signs of temporal or spatial
auto-correlation were detected in auto-correlation plots or variograms.

Two possible models emerged to capture the fixed effects:

$$
rain + sqrt\_traffic + devAge2
$$

$$
rain + sqrt\_CO_2\_road + devAge2
$$

The AIC score for these models was 1240.2 and 1245.7, respectively
(models fitted with ML). We selected the first model as the most
suitable for TSS. Figure 4.13 shows the model fit for each individual
predictor, plotted against data points. Correlation between the two
predictors was low (correlation coefficient = 0.3).

![](images/TSS%20single%20predictor%20plots.bmp)

**Figure 4.13** Single-predictor plots for TSS, showing fit of the
Landscape Predictor Model to each predictor. Model fitting was performed
using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.14) and comparative metrics such as AIC. The residual plots clearly
show good fit (residuals close to zero) for the Categorical Landuse
Model and for the Landscape Predictor Model.

![](images/TSS%20residual%20plot%203%20models.bmp)

**Figure 4.14** TSS model residuals for the Null Model, Categorical Land
Use Model, and Landscape Predictor Model. Each bar represents one
watershed, with colors representing agencies. Model fitting was
performed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Final frequentist model AIC values (fitted with REML) for the three
models are: 1431.7 (Null Model), 1258.3 (Categorical Landuse Model) and
1252.8 (Landscape Predictor Model), with the Landscape Predictor Model
showing significant improvement over the Categorical Landuse Model.
Final coefficient values for all three frequentist models are shown in
Figure 4.15. The larger variability around Categorical Landuse Model
coefficients (shown in blue) indicates lower predictive power compared
to the Landscape Predictor Model, because confidence intervals on
predictions will be large.

![](images/TSS%20model%20parameters%20plot.bmp)

**Figure 4.15** Model coefficients for the Null Model (green),
Categorical Land Use Model (blue), and Landscape Predictor Model (red).
Final coefficient values for linear mixed effects models are based on
fitting with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation, and may
differ slightly from those fitted using maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation.

**Bayesian summary (plots are in development):**

The Bayesian model for TSS is:

$$
\ln(TSS_{ijk}) = 10.29 + 0.16*rain_{i} + 0.38*sqrt\_traffic_{ijk} + 0.32*devAge2_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

Rain is 1-day cumulative precipitation, standardized. Both landscape
predictors were first transformed then standardized prior to use.
Subscripts indicate sample (*i*), location (*j*) and agency (*k*).

Random effects ($a_k$ and $a_{j|k}$) and residual variance
$\epsilon_{ijk}$ follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

$$
a_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{agency});\quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{agency} = 0.28
$$

$$
a_{j|k}\sim N(0, \sigma_{location}); \quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{location} = 0.38
$$

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma_j); \quad\text{    }\quad ln(\sigma_j) = \eta + u_j \quad\text{    }\quad \eta=-0.08; 
$$ $$ 
u_j \sim N(0,\sigma_0); \quad\text{    }\quad \sigma_0=0.30
$$

The Stormwater Heatmap presents the median predicted value over time
(i.e., median over all seasons and precipitation regimes), and use the
equation:

$$
\ln(TSS) = 10.29 + 0.38*sqrt\_traffic + 0.32*devAge2
$$

### Phosphorus

Based on linear models of *ln*-transformed total phosphorus (hereafter
referred to only as phosphorus) versus individual predictors, the strong
predictors identified for phosphorus include: urbRES, roofs,
sqrt_traffic, sqrt_popn, pm25_na, sqrt_slope, sqrt_CO2_res,
sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_road and devAge2 (Fig 4.16).

![](images/Phosphorus%20strong%20predictors.bmp)

**Figure 4.16** Strong predictors for phosphorus, showing linear model
fit (blue line) for the relationship between ln-transformed phosphorus
concentration and each predictor in turn.

The precipitation predictor used for phosphorus was 21-day cumulative
precipitation. In addition, evidence of higher phosphorus concentrations
during summer led us to add *summer* as a categorical predictor to the
phosphorus model (where *summer* = 1 during July, August, September, and
*summer* = 0 for all other months).

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight
heterogeneity (Fig 4.17, left plot). Of the variance structures tested,
the best fit allows residual variation to differ by location *j*:

$$
sd(\epsilon_{ijk}) = \sigma_j
$$

![](images/Phosphorus%20variance%20structure.bmp)

**Figure 4.17** Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no
variance structure (top left), with agency as a variance covariate (top
right) and with location as a variance covariate (bottom left). Location
as the variance covariate provided the best model fit.

The best model for phosphorus is a random-intercept model, where the
intercept of the linear model is allowed to vary by agency (*k*), and by
location within each agency (*j*\|*k*). No signs of temporal or spatial
auto-correlation were detected in auto-correlation plots or variograms.

Two possible models emerged to capture the fixed effects:

$$
rain + summer + sqrt\_CO_2\_road
$$

$$
rain + summer
$$

The AIC score for the first model was slightly lower than that of the
second model (AIC=813.6 vs. 814.7, when models were fitted with ML). In
the first model, the predictor $sqrt\_CO_2\_road$ has a p-value of 0.08
when fitted with ML, indicating that it can be dropped from the model.
However, dropping the single landscape predictor results in a model with
no predictive potential for the Stormwater Heatmap. As a result, we
selected the model that includes $sqrt\_CO_2\_road$. Information for the
rain + summer only model is also provided below.

Figure 4.18 shows the model fit for $sqrt\_CO_2\_road$, plotted against
data points.

![](images/Phosphorus%20single%20predictors.bmp)

**Figure 4.18** Single-predictor plots for phosphorus, showing fit of
the Landscape Predictor Model to the single predictor. Model fitting was
performed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.19), comparative metrics such as AIC. The residual plots clearly show
good fit (residuals close to zero) for the Categorical Landuse Model,
Landscape Predictor Model, and the Rain + Summer Only Model.

![](images/Phosphorus%20residual%20plots%204%20models.bmp)

**Figure 4.19** Phosphorus model residuals for the Null Model,
Categorical Land Use Model, Landscape Predictor Model, and Rain + Summer
Only Model (alternate model). Each bar represents one watershed, with
colors representing agencies. Model fitting was performed using maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation.

Final frequentist model AIC values (fitted with REML) for the four
models are: 1157.2 (Null Model), 829.8 (Categorical Landuse Model),
825.1 (Landscape Predictor Model) and 824.0 (Rain + Summer Model). The
Landscape Predictor Model shows an improvement over the Categorical
Landuse Model, and the Rain + Summer Model has the lowest AIC, slightly
improving over the Landscape Predictor Model. Final coefficient values
for all four frequentist models are shown in Figure 4.20.

![](images/Phosphorus%20model%20predictor%20values.bmp)**Figure 4.20**
Frequentist model coefficients for the Null Model (green), Categorical
Land Use Model (blue), Landscape Predictor Model (red), and Rain +
Summer Model (purple). These coefficient values for linear mixed effects
models are based on fitting with restricted maximum likelihood (REML)
estimation, and may differ slightly from those fitted using maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation.

**Bayesian summary (plots are in development):**

The Landscape Predictor model is slightly better than the Rain + Summer
model in the Bayesian modeling framework, when compared with the LOOCV.

The Bayesian model for total phosphorous follows a Student-t
distribution, where:

$$
\ln(P_{ijk}) = 4.55 - 0.15*rain_{i} + 0.51*summer_{i} + 0.30*sqrt\_CO_2\_road_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

Rain is 21-day cumulative precipitation, standardized; and summer is a
factor with value = 1 for July, August, September, and value = 0 for all
other months. The $CO_2\_road$ predictor was first square-root
transformed, then standardized prior to use. Subscripts indicate sample
(*i*), location (*j*) and agency (*k*).

Random effects ($a_k$ and $a_{j|k}$) follow a normal (Gaussian)
distribution, and residual variance $\epsilon_{ijk}$ follows a Student-t
distribution with $\nu=13.4$:

$$
a_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{agency});\quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{agency} = 0.55
$$

$$
a_{j|k}\sim N(0, \sigma_{location}); \quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{location} = 0.51
$$

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \sim t_{13.4}(0, \sigma_j); \quad\text{    }\quad ln(\sigma_j) = \eta + u_j \quad\text{    }\quad \eta=-0.64; 
$$ $$ 
u_j \sim N(0,\sigma_0); \quad\text{    }\quad \sigma_0=0.30
$$

The Stormwater Heatmap presents the median predicted value over time
(i.e., median over all seasons and precipitation regimes), and use the
equation:

$$
\ln(P) = 4.55 + 0.30*sqrt\_CO_2\_road
$$

Total phosphorus turned out to be a challenging chemical to model in
stormwater, perhaps because its main sources are from divergent land
uses. Waschbusch et al. (1999) found that lawns and roads contributed
\~80% of total and dissolved phosphorous loading, and that land use
affects the contribution from different sources: lawns and leaf litter
are more important in residential areas, while roads are more important
in commercial and industrial areas. Future efforts could focus on
identifying more effective landscape predictors for total phosphorus.

### Total Zinc

Based on linear models of ln-transformed total zinc versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for total zinc include:
totRES, intURB_IND, grass, greenery, paved, impervious, trees,
sqrt_traffic, pm25_na, sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_com, sqrt_CO2_nonroad, and
roof_intURB_IND (Fig 4.21).

![](images/Total%20Zinc%20strong%20predictors%20plot.bmp)

**Figure 4.21** Strong predictors for total zinc, showing linear model
fit (blue line) for the relationsihp between *ln*-transformed total
zince concentration and each predictor in turn.

The precipitation predictor used for total zinc was 14-day cumulative
precipitation. In addition, evidence of higher total zinc concentrations
during summer led us to add *summer* as a categorical predictor to the
total zinc model (where *summer* = 1 during July, August, and September,
and *summer*= 0 for all other months).

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed a pattern, indicating a
chance of slight heteroskedasticity (Fig. 4.22, top left). Of the
variance structures tested, the best fit allows residual variation to
differ by location *j*.

$$
sd(\epsilon_j) = \sigma_j
$$

![](images/Total%20Zinc%20variance%20structure.bmp)**Figure 4.22**
Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no variance
structure (top left), with agency as a variance covariate (top right),
and with location as a variance covariate (bottom left). Location as the
variance covariate provided the best model fit.

The best model for total zinc is a random-intercept model, where the
intercept of the linear model is allowed to vary by agency (*k*), as
well as by location within each agency (*j*\|*k*). No signs of temporal
or spatial auto-correlation were detected in auto-correlation plots or
variograms.

Two possible models emerged to capture the fixed effects:

$$
rain + summer + paved + sqrt\_CO_2\_tot + rain*paved
$$

$$
rain + summer + greenery + sqrt\_traffic + rain*greenery
$$

The AIC scores for these two models were very close, with the first
model's AIC score slightly higher than that of the second model
(AIC=722.7 vs. 721.5, when models were fitted with ML). The predictor
p-values for the first model were all very low (p-value \< 0.005),
whereas one predictor in the second model (*sqrt_traffic*) had a p-value
of 0.05. As a result, we selected the first model. Figure 4.23 shows the
model fit for each individual predictor, plotted against data points.
Correlation between the two predictors was low (correlation coefficient
= 0.3).

![](images/Total%20Zinc%20single%20predictors.bmp)**Figure 4.23**
Single-predictor plots for total zinc, showing fit of the Landscape
Predictor Model to each predictor. Model fitting was performed using
maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Figure 4.24 shows the interaction between rain and paved, with more
paved watersheds shown in reds and oranges, and less paved watersheds
shown in blues and purples. In highly paved areas, there is a stronger
first-flush effect; greater amounts of 14-day cumulative rainfall reduce
the subsequent zinc concentration in stormwater.

![](images/Total%20Zinc%20interaction%20plot%20rain_paved.bmp)**Figure
4.24** Plot showing the interaction between rain and paved that is
present in the best fit model. In highly paved areas, increasing amounts
of rain result in a dilution of zinc in stormwater. Model fitting was
performed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.25) and comparative metrics such as AIC. The residual plots clearly
show good fit (residuals close to zero) for the Categorical Landuse
Model and for the Landscape Predictor Model.

Use Model, and Landscape Predictor Model. Each bar represents one
watershed, with colors representing agencies. Model fitting was

Final frequentist model AIC values (fitted with REML) for the three
models are: 1324.53 (Null Model), 748.4 (Categorical Landuse Model), and
745.2 (Landscape Predictor Model), with the Landscape Predictor Model
showing an improvement over the Categorical Landuse Model. Final
coefficient values for all three frequentist models are shown in Figure
4.26. The large variability in model coefficients for the Categorical
Landuse Model (shown in blue) indicates low predictive power, because
confidence intervals on predictions will be large.

![](images/Total%20Zinc%20model%20parameters.bmp)

**Figure 4.26** Frequentist model coefficients for the Null Model
(green), Categorical Land Use Model (blue), and Landscape Predictor
Model (red). Final coefficient values for linear mixed effects models
are based on fitting with REML, and may differ slightly from coefficient
values based on fitting with ML.

**Bayesian summary (plots are in development):**

The Bayesian model for total zinc follows a Student-t distribution,
where:

$$
ln(totZn_{ijk}) = 4.10 - 0.16*rain_{i} + 0.39*summer_{i} + 0.36*sqrt\_traffic_{ijk} + 0.69*paved_{ijk} - 0.08*rain_{i}*paved_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

Rain is 14-day cumulative precipitation, standardized; and summer is a
factor with value = 1 for July, August, September, and value = 0 for all
other months. Landscape predictors were first transformed, if necessary
($traffic$ was square-root transformed), then standardized prior to use.
Subscripts indicate sample (*i*), location (*j*) and agency (*k*).

Random effects ($a_k$ and $a_{j|k}$) follow a normal (Gaussian)
distribution, and residual variance $\epsilon_{ijk}$ follows a Student-t
distribution with $\nu=17.43$.

$$
a_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{agency});\quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{agency} = 0.35
$$

$$
a_{j|k}\sim N(0, \sigma_{location}); \quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{location} = 0.47
$$

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma_j); \quad\text{    }\quad ln(\sigma_j) = \eta + u_j \quad\text{    }\quad \eta=-0.76; 
$$ $$ 
u_j \sim N(0,\sigma_0); \quad\text{    }\quad \sigma_0=0.35
$$

The Stormwater Heatmap presents the median predicted value over time
(i.e., median over all seasons and precipitation regimes), and use the
equation:

$$
\ln(totZn) = 4.10 + 0.36*sqrt\_traffic + 0.69*paved
$$

### Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen

Out of 421 Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) samples, 41 samples (9.7%) were
flagged as non-detects, with a variety of detection limits ranging from
30 to 500. The majority of non-detect samples came from three agencies:
Pierce County, Port of Tacoma, and Snohomish County (Fig. 4.27). High
detection limits in Pierce County and Port of Tacoma strongly truncated
the lower half of these data sets. One non-detect sample from TAC_HDR
was flagged by the laboratory as estimated, with an estimated value of
255. For the purposes of our analysis, we assume that this estimated
sample value is correct.

![](images/TKN%20sample%20values%20prior%20to%20ROS.bmp)**Figure 4.27**
Concentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen in samples collected by
location. Red dots indicate detected values, while turqoise dots
indicate the detection limit for samples flagged as non-detect.

Although the EPA allows substitution of (0.5 x detection limit) for
censored values when less than 15% of samples are non-detect (USEPA,
2009), substitution can add a pattern to the data that is different than
the pattern of the data itself (Helsel, 2012). As a result, we performed
regression on order statistics (ROS) at each location using the NADA
package (Lee, 2020). ROS uses the uncensored and censored values to
model the likely data distribution, then draws from the distribution to
generate modeled values for the censored data. Because we ran ROS on a
location-by-location basis, we do not anticipate the introduction of
extraneous patterns that affect the landscape predictors. Rainfall and
seasonality patterns could potentially be affected for the 40 data
points that were generated through ROS; however, because \>90% of data
were not censored, this effect should be relatively small. Figure 4.28
shows the modeled concentrations of TKN in turquoise. All statistics
were performed using the modeled values generated by ROS, in place of
censored data.

![](images/TKN%20ROS%20modeled%20data%20points.bmp)**Figure 4.28**
Actual (red) and modeled (turquoise) concentrations of total Kjeldahl
nitrogen in samples collected by location. Modeled values were generated
by regression on order statistics, to replace the detection limit on
censored data.

Based on linear models of *ln*-transformed TKN versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for TKN include: roofs,
nodev, traffic, sqrt_popn, sqrt_CO2_res, sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_road,
devAge2, roof_inURB and roof_intURB_IND (Fig. 4.29).

![](images/TKN%20strong%20predictors.bmp)**Figure 4.29** Strong
predictors for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), showing linear model fit
(blue line) for the relationship between *ln*-transformed TKN
concentration and each predictor in turn.

The precipitation predictor used for TKN was 14-day cumulative
precipitation. In addition, evidence of higher TKN concentrations during
summer led us to add summer as a categorical predictor to the TKN model
(where summer = 1 during July, August, September, and summer = 0 for all
other months).

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight
heterogeneity (Fig. 4.30, top left plot). Of the variance structures
tested, the best fit allows residual variation to differ by agency *k*.

$$
sd(\epsilon_k)=\sigma_k
$$

![](images/TKN%20variance%20structure_censtat.bmp)**Figure 4.30**
Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no variance
structure (top left), with agency as a variance covariate (top right),
and with location as a variance covariate (bottom left). Agency as the
variance covariate provided the best model fit.

The best model for TKN is a random-intercept model, where the intercept
of the linear model is allowed to vary by agency (*k*), as well as by
location within each agency (*j*\|*k*). No signs of temporal or spatial
auto-correlation were detected in auto-correlation plots or variograms.

Three possible models emerged to capture the fixed effects:

$$
rain + summer + sqrt\_traffic + devAge2
$$

$$
rain + summer + sqrt\_CO_2\_road + devAge2
$$

$$
rain + summer + sqrt\_traffic + nodev
$$

Each of these models captures two major contributors to total nitrogen:
vehicles, and amount/age of development. The AIC scores for all three
models were relatively close (796.6, 799.7, 801.4, respectively, when
models were fitted using ML).

We selected the first model, with landscape predictors *sqrt_traffic* +
*devAge2*. While all models fit the data reasonably well, we felt that
traffic (rather than emissions) were more likely to characterize the
movement of TKN into stormwater. Also, *devAge2* was a stronger
predictor in the first model (p-value = 0.006), compared to *nodev* in
the third model (p-value = 0.032). Figure 4.31 shows the model fit for
each individual predictor, plotted against data points. Correlation
between the two predictors was low (correlation coefficient = 0.4).

![](images/TKN%20single%20predictors.bmp)**Figure 4.31**

Landscape Predictor Model to each predictor. Model fitting was performed

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.32) and comparative metrics such as AIC. The residual plots clearly
show good fit (residuals close to zero) for the Categorical Landuse
Model and for the Landscape Predictor Model.

Use Model, and Landscape Predictor Model. Each bar represents one
watershed, with colors representing agencies. Model fitting was
performed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Final frequentist model AIC values (fitted with REML) for the three
models are: 1083.8 (Null Model), 819.4 (Categorical Landuse Model) and
815.5 (Landscape Predictor Model), with the Landscape Predictor Model
showing an improvement over the Categorical Landuse Model. Final
coefficient values for all three frequentist models are shown in Figure
4.33. The relatively large variability in model coefficients for the
Categorical Landuse Model (shown in blue) indicates lower predictive
power, because confidence intervals on predictions will be large.

fitted using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

**Bayesian summary (plots are in development):**

The Bayesian model for TKN was constructed using the censored data
function within the brms package. The best fit model follows a Student-t
distribution where:

$$
\ln(TKN_{ijk}) = 6.61 - 0.17*rain_i + 0.58*summer_i + 0.23*sqrt\_traffic_{ijk} + 0.22*devAge2_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

Rain is 14-day cumulative precipitation, standardized; and summer is a
factor with value = 1 for July, August, September, and value = 0 for all
other months. Landscape predictors were first transformed, if necessary
(*traffic* was square-root transformed, *devAge* was squared), then
standardized prior to use. Subscripts indicate sample (*i*), location
(*j*) and agency (*k*).

Random effects ($a_k$ and $a_{j|k}$) follow a normal (Gaussian)
distribution, and residual variance $\epsilon_{ijk}$ follows a Student-t
distribution with $\nu=3.35$:$$
a_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{agency});\quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{agency} = 0.18
$$

$$
a_{j|k}\sim N(0, \sigma_{location}); \quad\text{  }\quad \sigma_{location} = 0.22
$$

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \sim t_{3.03}(0, \sigma_k); \quad\text{    }\quad ln(\sigma_k) = \eta + u_k \quad\text{    }\quad \eta=-0.80; 
$$ $$ u_k \sim N(0,\sigma_0); \quad\text{    }\quad \sigma_0=0.58
$$

Predictions presented in the Stormwater Heatmap represent the median
predicted value over time (i.e., median over all seasons and
precipitation regimes), and use the equation:

$$
ln(TKN) = 6.61 + 0.23*sqrt\_traffic + 0.22*devAge2
$$

## Translating Equations to the Stormwater Heatmap

The process of translating statistical equations for chemical
contaminants to the Stormwater heatmap involved manipulation of the grid
and equations.

### Preparing the Base Map

The Puget Sound watersheds base map was prepared through three steps:

1.  each grid was convolved on the base map,

2.  the range of landscape predictor values was truncated,

3.  regression equations were applied using landscape predictor values
    in each grid box.

**[CHRISTIAN - ADD A FEW SENTENCES ABOUT HOW EACH GRID WAS CONVOLVED:
for example, is each grid square made up of many smaller parts? Why was
convolving necessary? What are the dimensions of each grid square/
rectangle?]**

Truncation of landscape predictor values was necessary because, for some
predictors, the min and/or max over the entire Puget Sound region are
far beyond the range of landscape predictor values in the S8 monitoring
data that were used for generating model equations. We calculated the
mean and standard deviation for each landscape predictor over the 14 S8
monitoring locations, and capped the Puget Sound base map to 3 standard
deviations of the mean. **[CHRISTIAN - IS THIS CORRECT? OR DID WE FIRST
TRANSFORM AND CENTER DATA, *THEN* CAP AT 3 SD'S?]** This helps avoid
extrapolating beyond the range where linear relationships between
predictors and COCs may no longer apply.

**CHRISTIAN - I WOULD LOVE A FIGURE HERE -- A BOX PLOT SHOWING THE RANGE
OF VALUES FOR EACH OF THE PREDICTORS WE USE (sqrt_traffic, devAge2,
sqrt_CO2_road, sqrt_CO2_tot, paved), WITH THE TRUNCATED RANGE SHOWN NEXT
TO EACH BOX. I CAN MAKE THE FIGURE IF YOU PROVIDE THE DATA, OR IF YOU'D
LIKE TO MAKE/ADD IT, THAT IS FINE TOO.**

Truncation was especially important for the traffic predictor, because
traffic levels on high-volume roads such as freeways can far exceed the
traffic levels in our monitored locations. The maximum traffic level in
the base map was capped at 31,000 AADT **[CHRISTIAN - IS THIS THE
CORRECT VALUE AT WHICH WE CAPPED TRAFFIC?]**. On freeways, which were
not analyzed in this study, traffic can reach 240,000 AADT. Using
highway runoff data from the whole United States (USGS Highway Runoff
DataBase, accessed 11/01/21), we observed that linear equations for TSS
provide predictions that are too high when traffic is allowed to reach
levels near 240,000, but provide believable predictions when traffic
levels are capped at 31,000 AADT. This suggests that, for at least some
COCs, traffic may be a linear predictor over the values found in our
data, but may reach an asymptote at much higher traffic volumes. It also
suggests that caution should be used when interpreting predictions for
areas with exceptionally high traffic volumes.

### Applying Mixed Effects Equations to the Stormwater Heatmap

The equations that were fitted to the S8 monitoring data required a
specified variance structure to account for heteroskedasticity, as well
as a nested structure for the random effects. Homoskedasticity is an
important pre-requisite to constructing linear models between predictors
and dependent variables, and both the locations and the agencies had
some level of variability in the spreads of their data (Fig. 4.35).

![](images/TSS%20variability%20by%20location%20and%20agency_color.bmp)**Figure
4.35** Spread of the S8 monitoring data for total suspended solids (TSS)
by location (top) and by agency (bottom), with color coding by agency.
Note the variability in spread per location (e.g., blue boxes vs. green
boxes) as well as per agency (e.g., red boxes vs. green boxes).

With respect to translating mixed effects model equations to the
Stormwater Heatmap, the equations are substantially simplified.
Predicting mean COC concentrations allow the variance structure and
nested random effects terms to go to their mean value of 0. Furthermore,
rainfall and the summer predictor, where applicable, are also set to
their mean value of 0. Thus the generic COC equation: $$
\ln(COC_{ijk}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1*rain_i + \beta_2*summer_i + \beta_3*predictor1_{ijk} + \beta_4*predictor2_{ijk} + a_k + a_{j|k} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

$$
a_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{agency})
$$

$$
a_{j|k}\sim N(0, \sigma_{location})
$$

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma_k)
$$

becomes simplified to:

$$
\ln(COC) = \beta_0 + \beta_1*0 + \beta_2*0 + \beta_3*predictor1 + \beta_4
*predictor2 + 0 + 0 + 0
$$

and finally:

$$
\ln(COC) = \beta_0 + \beta_3*predictor1 + \beta_4*predictor2
$$
