**Predictors reduced by watershed**

This files contain scaled and centered predictors summarized by various watershed layers. 

**Predictors in this dataset:**

* devAge2
* grass
* paved 
* pm25_na
* sqrt_CO2_road 
* sqrt transformed traffic

Predictors have been scaled and centered, but not clamped. 

**Watershed polygon layers** 

Three watershed delination layers are included: 

* HUC-12 - [USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset of Subwatersheds ](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_WBD_2017_HUC12) 
* PSAU - [Puget Sound Assessment Units] (https://ecology.wa.gov/Water-Shorelines/Puget-Sound/Watershed-characterization-project) From the Ecology Watershed 
Characterization Project. 
* NHDPLUS - [NHDPlus High Resolution Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution) 

The mean value of predictors was calculated at a 10-meter scale.
